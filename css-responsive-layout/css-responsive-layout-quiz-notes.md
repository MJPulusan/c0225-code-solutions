## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  it is the specific values on which the content will adapt in order for it to have a best possible result.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  using percentage will base the sizing to the original size that was assigned. it helps the layout to be more proportional when adjusted.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller width after the styles for a larger width in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the smaller width will "win". Why is that?
  because it makes the layout more readable when expanded. rather than having the design squeeze in.
