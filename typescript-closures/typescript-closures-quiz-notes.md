  It is determined at Script Load, at the time a function is defined at run time.

  Variables in its own scope and from the global variables, parameters of outside function.

- When is a closure created?
  it is created whenever a function is defined inside another function that keeps a reference to its surrounding scope.
  Also, any time an inner function is returned or assigned to a variable, it retains access to its outer functionâ€™s variables.

- How can you tell if a function will be created with a closure?

3. It remains accessible after the outer function has executed
