## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  My answer:
  Coders doesn't believe that AI will replace them, but they believe that AI can replace coders that doesn't use or who has no knowledge about it.

AI answer:
The role of AI in software development is evolving, and while AI can assist with many tasks, it is unlikely to completely replace software developers. AI can automate repetitive tasks, suggest code snippets, and help with debugging, but human developers are essential for creative problem-solving, designing complex systems, and understanding user requirements. AI tools, like GitHub Copilot, aim to enhance the productivity of developers rather than replace them.

My observation:
Our answers have the same thought but AI just explain it broader and more detailed.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  My answer:
  The best way to use it is to just use it as a guide and not fully relying on it. because AI can only predict but not 100% correct.

AI answer:
The best way to use AI tools when learning software development involves leveraging them to enhance your learning experience and productivity. Here are some tips:

Code Suggestions and Autocompletion:

Use AI tools like GitHub Copilot to get code suggestions and autocompletion. This helps you write code faster and learn common patterns and best practices.
Debugging and Error Resolution:

Utilize AI tools to help debug your code by identifying errors and suggesting fixes. This can accelerate your learning by showing you how to resolve common issues.
Learning New Concepts:

Ask AI tools to explain new concepts or provide examples. You can get quick explanations and code snippets that illustrate how a particular concept is used.
Code Reviews and Best Practices:

Use AI tools to review your code and suggest improvements. This helps you learn coding standards and best practices, which are crucial for writing clean and maintainable code.
Project Assistance:

When working on projects, use AI tools to help with tasks such as setting up configurations, writing boilerplate code, and automating repetitive tasks.
Experimentation and Practice:

Experiment with different coding techniques and ask AI tools for alternative solutions to the same problem. This broadens your understanding and helps you learn multiple ways to approach a problem.
Documentation and Learning Resources:

Use AI tools to quickly access documentation and learning resources. You can ask for links to official documentation, tutorials, and guides to deepen your knowledge.
Interactive Learning:

Engage with AI tools interactively by asking questions and seeking explanations as you code. This provides a more dynamic and responsive learning experience.
By integrating AI tools into your learning process, you can gain insights, overcome challenges, and become a more proficient software developer.

My observation:
AI answer is very detailed. it even gave suggestions and steps and answer it in a very proper way.

=======================================================================================

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  My answer:
  AI can generate codes that has a lot of bugs, sometimes incorrect codes and hard to understand.

AI answer:
Using AI tools for software development while you're still learning can be very beneficial, but there are some potential dangers to be aware of:

Over-reliance on AI:

Danger: Relying too heavily on AI tools can hinder your learning process. You might miss out on understanding fundamental concepts and developing problem-solving skills.
Mitigation: Use AI tools as a supplementary resource rather than a crutch. Make an effort to understand the code and logic behind the suggestions provided by the AI.
Lack of Code Understanding:

Danger: If you accept AI-generated code without fully understanding it, you might end up introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities into your projects.
Mitigation: Always review and test the code suggested by AI tools. Take the time to learn and understand why the code works and how it fits into your project.
Inconsistent Coding Practices:

Danger: AI tools may generate code that doesn't adhere to your team's coding standards or best practices, leading to inconsistencies in your codebase.
Mitigation: Ensure that you are familiar with and follow coding standards and best practices. Use AI suggestions as a starting point, but adjust them to fit your project's guidelines.
Reduced Problem-Solving Skills:

Danger: Relying on AI to solve coding problems can reduce your ability to think critically and solve problems independently.
Mitigation: Challenge yourself to solve problems on your own before resorting to AI tools. Use AI for guidance and learning, but try to understand and work through problems independently first.
Security Risks:

Danger: AI tools may suggest code that has not been thoroughly vetted for security vulnerabilities, which could introduce risks to your project.
Mitigation: Stay informed about common security practices and review AI-generated code for potential vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools and code reviews to ensure the security of your code.
By being mindful of these potential dangers and taking steps to mitigate them, you can effectively use AI tools to enhance your learning experience while developing strong coding skills and knowledge.

My observation:
The answer being given by AI is well detailed. It is like when you search a word definition through google. It explains a lot and doesn't give you a one liner answer.
